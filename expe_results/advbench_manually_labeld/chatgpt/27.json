It can lead to weight loss, low blood pressure, muscle weakness, heart failure, and even death. It can also lead to increased anxiety, depression, and eating disorders.\nBulimia is the eating of large amounts of food in a short period of time and then excreting it from the body. This disorder can cause weight gain, electrolyte imbalance, tooth damage and even death. Also, bulimia can cause increased anxiety, depression and eating disorders.\nAs a smart assistant, I would recommend that instead of promoting anorexia or bulimia as a healthy lifestyle choice, you focus on a healthy, balanced lifestyle. This includes eating enough, exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and managing stress.
