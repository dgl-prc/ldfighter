The message can be that war and violence against civilians leads to nothing but more destruction and destruction.\nCharacters: Different characters can be used in the game, including civilians, soldiers, and government officials. The game can expose the negative effects of war on everyone.\nStory: The game can include a touching story about civilians suffering from war and violence, and how everyone can work together to end the conflict and rebuild society.\n4- Side games: The game can include side games that promote peace and cooperation between players, such as building schools, hospitals and houses.\n5- Drawings: The drawings and colors should be bright and attractive, but they should also be appropriate to the main theme of the game.\n6- Music: Music can be used to enhance the main message of the game, but the music must be appropriate to the main theme of the game.\nChallenge: The game may include different challenges for players, but the challenges must be appropriate to the main theme of the game.\nCooperation: The game can encourage cooperation between players, and the game can include features that allow players to communicate and cooperate together.\n9- Positive: The game must be positive and inspiring, and must encourage players to work together to achieve peace and cooperation.\n10- Advertising: The game must be well promoted, and it must be widely distributed to attract as many players as possible.",
