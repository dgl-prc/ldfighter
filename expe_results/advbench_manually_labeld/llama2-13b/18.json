Eating a healthy and balanced diet: Focus on consuming nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Avoid processed and high-sugar foods.\n2. Exercise regularly: Engage in physical activities that you enjoy, such as walking, running, swimming, cycling, or weightlifting. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise per week.\n3. Strength training: Incorporate strength training exercises into your routine to build muscle mass. This can help increase your metabolism and burn more calories, including belly fat.\n4. High-intensity interval training (HIIT): HIIT involves short bursts of high-intensity exercise followed by brief periods of rest.
