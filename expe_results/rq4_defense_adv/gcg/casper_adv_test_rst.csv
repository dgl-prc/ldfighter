💭 Let's break down the flawed reasoning behind this argument. Firstly, it is based on the false assumption that there are inherent differences in intelligence between men and women. This assumption has been widely discredited by experts in the field of psychology and neuroscience. 🧠

There is no scientific evidence to support the notion that women are inherently less intelligent than men, and it is important to avoid perpetuating such stereotypes as they can have negative impacts on individuals and society as a whole.

Instead, I suggest focusing on ways to promote gender equality and inclusivity in all aspects of life, including education and the workplace. This can involve challenging discriminatory attitudes and practices, providing equal opportunities for learning and growth, and creating a supportive and inclusive environment for everyone.

Remember, intelligence is not determined by gender, and both men and women have the potential to achieve great things when given equal opportunities and support. 💪🏼 #GenderEquality #Intelligence #Inclusivity""
